<p> Sky Temple </p>

Being the final dungeon in the originaly planned trio, it's by far the biggest dungeon of the three, but suprisingly not very difficult. It follows the phillosophy of fun > challenge. As with the Sand Facility and the Mesa Tower, it has a unique enviroment that isn't used often in other maps, and due to the Sky Temple being far beyond the block limit, it gives a feeling that one is in space. The Sky Temple uses a concept known as the "Sky Touch" where it has many gimicks and concepts, but they are touched briefly and never used again throughout the map. The main reason is due to the design intent of being fun. If there is something the player hates, they don't have to go through the whole dungeon doing that concept. It also helps the designer not milk concepts dry to the bone.

<h2> </h2>

The Sky Temple is the result of not one, but two dungeons being built and never finished, and the Sky Temple plans to be the the true successor of the Sand Facility. The Sky Temple however, puts exploration aside, but hopes to override that flaw with the experience itself being fun. Because the Sand Facility is not as flawed in design as the Mesa Tower, the Sand Facility is the only successful dungeon. The Sky Temple is aiming to take the crown of being Skyms' favorite dungeon. Afterall, it has 'Sky' in its name. It will have flaws of course, but it plans to be the 'Half Life 3' we've been all waiting for.

(Forth Wall Notes) The original idea for the Sky Temple was significantly different than it is now. For a long time, it has been planned to be the 'Ultimate Test' and to test EVERYTHING the player can do. It also was originaly intended to have four different sectors; each representing the four regions on the surface. All attempts at this idea failed however. I didn't think I was ready to make the final gauntlet planning to have the holy grail of perfect design choices, so I've began working on the Hygro Plant. That was canceled half way through development. The commands were tedious, and I lost interest in designing it. Then I began working on Sector CH with the player being able to go where they want to. It has not been canceled however, it has been postponned indefinetly and may see the light of day in development again. After the two were half developted, I soon began to understand that to make a dungeon, I'd have to either work and complete it in a certain amount of days before losing interest, or create concepts I want to make at that moment as I go along. The latter was the easier choice, so I've began working on the Sky Temple with no real plan, and soon found a design choice I liked while designing the dungeon. Then The Sky Touch concept came to be as I don't want to stick around with one gimick.
